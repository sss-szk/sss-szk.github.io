<h1>Welcome to my GitHub Pages site!</h1>

<p>This is an example page that I've created using GitHub Pages.</p>

<p>Here are some of the things I've learned:</p>

<ul>
  <li>GitHub Pages is a great way to host simple websites for free.</li>
  <li>Jekyll makes it easy to create templates for your pages.</li>
  <li>Markdown is a great way to write content for the web.</li>
</ul>
